## What is VM Obfuscation?

VM Obfuscation compiles your code into a custom bytecode format that runs on a randomized virtual machine embedded within the output script.

### Benefits

- **Reverse Engineering Difficulty**: Extremely high.
- **Tamper Resistance**: Changes to the bytecode break execution.

### Usage

Enable `virtualMachine: true` in your configuration options.
