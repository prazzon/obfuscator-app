## Recommendations

1. **Layered Protection**: Combine VM obfuscation with control flow flattening.
2. **Performance Tuning**: Test heavily obfuscated code for performance impacts.
3. **Domain Locking**: Restrict execution to specific domains to prevent theft.
4. **Self-Defending**: Enable anti-tampering checks.
