## Overview

**Obfuscator.io** is a state-of-the-art JavaScript and TypeScript obfuscation tool designed to protect your intellectual property and prevent reverse engineering effectively. By transforming your original source code into a functionally equivalent but difficult-to-understand format, we ensure your application logic remains secure from prying eyes.

## Why Obfuscate?

In the modern web ecosystem, client-side code is exposed by default. This openness, while great for learning, poses significant risks for commercial applications, including:

- **Code Theft**: Competitors copying your unique algorithms or UI logic.
- **Tampering**: Malicious actors modifying your application to bypass payment gates or inject malware.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing your code to find vulnerabilities or sensitive logic.

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Advanced Control Flow Flattening

We restructure the control flow of your application, making the execution path non-linear and extremely difficult for humans and decompilers to follow.

### 🔒 String Concealing

Sensitive strings (like API keys, internal message types, or configuration values) are encrypted and hidden, decrypted only when necessary at runtime.

### ⚡ Performance Optimized

Our obfuscation techniques are fine-tuned to balance security with performance, ensuring your application remains fast and responsive.

### 🛠️ Easy Integration

Whether you use our [CLI](/docs/tutorial/cli), [Web Interface](/), or integrate directly via our [API](/docs/api-reference/authentication), getting started is seamless.

## Who is this for?

- **SaaS Providers**: Protect your frontend logic and licensing mechanisms.
- **Game Developers**: Prevent cheating and asset theft in HTML5 games.
- **Enterprise**: Secure internal tools and sensitive business logic deployed on the web.
